# What code were you given and what code did you create yourself?
I was provided a good chunk of the code for this project. The assignments purpose was to complete the Q-Training Algorithm so that the intelligent agent acheives its goal. I was able to get the pirate to reach the treasure by applying a deep Q-learning algorithm to solve the problem. I also attached my design defense that walks you through my approach, explanation of how the agent works, and evaluates the algorithm that I chose to use.

# What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists design and improve computer systems and software. We create algorithms, develop software, and work on artificial intelligence to make computers smarter. We also ensure that our interactions with technology are user-freidnly and secure. Our work underpins everything from smartphones to larger networks that keep data safe and systems running smoothly. Our innovations drive progress in many fields that make everyday life easier and more efficient. For example, we help improve healthcare through better data analysis and create smarter cities with advanced technology. We focus on cybersecurity to protect our information online. Overall, computer scientists solve the complex problems and develop technologies that shape the future; it makes our work crucial for modern society.

# How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Throughout this program, I have learned and developed a process for solving the problems that I am assigned. My process involves clearly defining and understanding the problem and gathering relevant information. I plan a solution by designing algorithms and choose the right tools for the job. I implement the solution by writing and testing code. I optimize and improve the solution for better performance. Finally, I document my work and seek feedback to make sure the solution provides the proper quality for the end user.

# What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization include ensuring privacy and data security that creates reliable and user-friendly software, being transparent about the capabilities and limitations of the products, avoiding biases in aolgorithms and data, and considering the broader social impacts of the technology.These responsibilities help to build trust, protect users, and make sure that technology benefits society as a whole.
